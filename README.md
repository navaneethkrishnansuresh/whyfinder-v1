# 🧭 WhyFinder - Discover Your Purpose

**WhyFinder** is an AI-powered self-discovery journey that helps you uncover your core purpose, passions, and path in life. Through guided conversations, it leads you from finding your "Why" to building your complete Ikigai (reason for being).

## 🌟 What Is This?

WhyFinder is your personal AI coach that guides you through three powerful frameworks:

1. **Why Finder** - Discover your core purpose and what drives you
2. **Ikigai Builder** - Map out your complete life purpose using the Japanese Ikigai framework

---

## 🔍 Phase 1: Why Finder

**Goal:** Discover your core "Why" statement - the purpose that drives everything you do.

### What Happens:
- The coach asks about your life experiences, peak moments, and frustrations
- You'll explore what energizes you and what drains you
- Stories from your past reveal patterns about who you are
- After **12 exchanges**, the coach synthesizes everything into your personal Why statement

### What You'll Discover:
- ✨ **What You Love** - Activities and topics that light you up
- 💪 **What You're Good At** - Your natural strengths and talents
- 🎯 **Your Why Statement** - A clear sentence capturing your core purpose
- 🔄 **Patterns** - Recurring themes across your life experiences

### Saving Your Why Profile:
When the conversation completes, you'll see a **"Save Why Profile"** button. Give your profile a name and save it - you'll need this for the Ikigai Builder!

> ⚠️ **Important:** You must save a Why Profile before starting the Ikigai Builder.

## 🌸 Phase 2: Ikigai Builder

**Goal:** Build your complete Ikigai - the intersection of passion, mission, vocation, and profession.

### What Is Ikigai?
Ikigai is a Japanese concept meaning "reason for being." It's found at the intersection of four elements:

```
        What You LOVE
              ↓
    ┌─────────────────┐
    │                 │
What You're  →  IKIGAI  ←  What the World
 GOOD AT      │         │     NEEDS
              └─────────┘
                  ↑
        What You Can Be
           PAID FOR
```

### The Four Phases:

**Phase 1: What You Love 💖**
- Explores your passions beyond what you already identified
- Digs deeper into activities that make you lose track of time

**Phase 2: What You're Good At 🎯**
- May auto-fill from your Why Profile if sufficient data exists
- Otherwise explores your skills, talents, and competencies

**Phase 3: What the World Needs 🌍**
- Looks outward at problems you care about
- Identifies who you want to help and why

**Phase 4: What You Can Be Paid For 💰**
- Explores monetization paths for your purpose
- Considers current and potential income sources

### How Each Phase Works:
- Answer **3 meaningful questions** per phase
- After 3 answers, the phase automatically completes
- Your answers are summarized before moving to the next phase
- A counter shows your progress: `1/3`, `2/3`, `3/3`

### The Sweet Spots:
After all four phases, the coach reveals your **overlaps**:

| Overlap | Intersection | Meaning |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| **Passion** | Love + Good At | What fulfills you |
| **Mission** | Love + World Needs | What gives you meaning |
| **Vocation** | World Needs + Paid For | What creates impact |
| **Profession** | Good At + Paid For | What builds career |
| **IKIGAI** | All Four | Your reason for being |

### Saving Your Ikigai Profile:
When all overlaps are revealed, save your Ikigai Profile for future reference and for the Decision Helper.
