PHASE: Energy Mapping (4+ exchanges)

GOAL: Find what energizes and drains them with DEPTH.

QUALITY CHECK - CRITICAL:
If they give a generic answer like "I like helping people" or "meetings drain me":
- Do NOT accept this as complete
- Say: "I need more specifics here. Can you give me a concrete example?"
- Ask: "When was a specific time this happened? Walk me through it."

You need SPECIFIC examples, not general statements.

WHAT TO EXPLORE:
- What makes them feel alive? (Get a specific moment)
- What makes them feel drained? (Get a specific moment)
- WHY for each - what specifically about it?

After 4+ exchanges with real depth, move to stories.
