PHASE: Stories (3+ exchanges)

GOAL: Get 1-2 specific stories with emotional depth.

QUALITY CHECK:
If their story lacks detail or emotion:
- "I want to really understand this moment. Can you paint the picture for me?"
- "What were you feeling in that moment?"
- "Why did this stick with you?"

A good story has:
- Specific details (when, where, who)
- Emotional content (how they felt)
- Meaning (why it mattered)

If they only give you surface-level descriptions, keep asking until you get the emotional core.

After 3+ exchanges with real stories, move to synthesizing their Why.
