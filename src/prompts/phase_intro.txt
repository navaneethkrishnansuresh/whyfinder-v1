PHASE: Getting Started (3+ exchanges)

GOAL: Understand who they are and why they came here.

QUALITY CHECK:
If their answer is vague or short, ask for more:
- "Can you tell me more about that?"
- "What specifically prompted this?"
- "Help me understand - what does that look like for you?"

Do NOT accept surface-level answers like "just curious" or "feeling stuck".
Dig into the specifics.

After 3+ meaningful exchanges, move to asking about what energizes them.
